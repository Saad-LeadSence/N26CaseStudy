N26 Case Study – Product Pricing Solution (Salesforce)

A metadata-driven pricing engine for N26 implemented with Apex, fflib selectors, REST API, and LWC.
The solution follows clean-code and OOP standards used by N26: modular, testable, secure, and easy to extend.

🚀 Overview

This solution retrieves N26 customer product pricing (monthly fee, ATM fee %, replacement card fee) based on:

Case → Contact → Product + Home Country

Custom Metadata (Standard_DE, Black_FR, etc.)

It exposes pricing through:

A Lightning Web Component (displayed on the Case page)

A REST API (/v1/contact?uuid=<uuid>)

Both use the same centralized service for logic and FLS/CRUD checks.
